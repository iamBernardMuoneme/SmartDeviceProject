## Getting Started

You are a junior data analyst working on the marketing analyst team at Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused
products for women. Bellabeat is a successful small company, but they have the potential to become a larger player in the
global smart device market. Urška Sršen, cofounder and Chief Creative Officer of Bellabeat, believes that analyzing smart
device fitness data could help unlock new growth opportunities for the company. You have been asked to focus on one of
Bellabeat’s products and analyze smart device data to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart devices. The
insights you discover will then help guide marketing strategy for the company. You will present your analysis to the Bellabeat
executive team along with your high-level recommendations for Bellabeat’s marketing strategy.

These questions
will guide your analysis:
1. What are some trends in smart device usage?
2. How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?
3. How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?

Sršen encourages you to use public data that explores smart device users’ daily habits. She points you to a specific data set:
● FitBit Fitness Tracker Data (CC0: Public Domain, dataset made available through Mobius): This Kaggle data set
contains personal fitness tracker from thirty fitbit users. Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of
personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. It includes
information about daily activity, steps, and heart rate that can be used to explore users’ habits.
Sršen tells you that this data set might have some limitations, and encourages you to consider adding another data to help
address those limitations as you begin to work more with this data.

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Data downloaded from Kaggle as a zip folder containing 18 csv files, files containing varying numbers of columns and rows which were sorted,cleaned and merged for further analysis
